Customer attrition means that a customer stops his or her business relationship with a company. It is the loss of customers by a business. Businesses classify a customer as churned(inactive) after a certain period when the customer is not active or make any transaction from the company. By losing customers, the business loses both revenue and the marketing costs involved in replacing them with new customers. 
The purpose of this project is to develop an AI model for looking into customer activity and pattern to provide customers that are at risk of likely to leave soon. The model provides customers that are at risk or will likely leave soon by looking into customers activity and pattern. The model also provides LOB an ability to utilize model output data for identifying merchants at risk, finding microsegments of merchants at risk, and develop corrective action to lower attrition.
