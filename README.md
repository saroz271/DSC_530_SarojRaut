Customer attrition means that a customer stops his or her business relationship with a company. It is the loss of customers by a business. Businesses classify a customer as churned(inactive) after a certain period when the customer is not active or make any transaction from the company. By losing customers, the business loses both revenue and the marketing costs involved in replacing them with new customers.
