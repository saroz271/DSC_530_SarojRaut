We are all familiar with the danger that earthquake poses. We have been taught from our young age to prepare for our safety. If we could predict when such an earthquake will occur, individuals can take preventative action, potentially saving countless lives and millions of dollars. 
Using data science to predict earthquakes is a challenging problem which researchers have been trying to solve for years but with little success. A solution to this problem can save thousands of innocent lives and revolutionize disaster management. It is well known that if a disaster has happened in a region, it is likely to happen there again. Some regions really have frequent earthquakes, but this is just a comparative quantity compared to other regions.
